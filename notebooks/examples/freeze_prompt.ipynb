      "[2025-12-07 22:00:52,389] [INFO] [assistant.run] - Your original prompt clearly specifies the **task** (summarize) and a strict **length constraint** (exactly 4 sentences), which is valuable but leaves many aspects of the behavior implicit. The improved prompt preserves your core intent—producing a 4‑sentence summary—but makes the expectations much more explicit and detailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key changes and why they help:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Role definition**:\n",
      "The final prompt begins with \"You are an expert system for automatic text summarization.\" This assigns a clear role, nudging the model to use more specialized, summary‑focused behavior rather than a generic answer style. Defining a role often improves coherence and quality for tasks like summarization.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarified task description**:\n",
      "Instead of just \"Summarize the text,\" the final prompt explains what the summary should do: preserve key ideas, main arguments, and important supporting points while omitting minor details, examples, and repetitions. This reduces ambiguity about what to keep and what to discard, guiding the model toward a more focused and useful summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Style and tone constraints**:\n",
      "The final prompt specifies \"concise, coherent summary\" in \"clear, neutral prose\" for a \"general audience\" and forbids adding new information or opinions. These additions control *how* the summary should read, helping avoid overly technical language, subjective commentary, or hallucinated content.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Content coverage and structure**:\n",
      "By requesting a \"fixed-length extractive–abstractive summary\" that \"fully covers the core content\" and has sentences that \"flow logically,\" the final prompt combines two important dimensions: coverage (don’t miss core ideas) and narrative coherence (sentences should connect well). This is more precise than the original, which only constrained length.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Formatting constraints**:\n",
      "The improved prompt explicitly forbids bullet points, headings, or meta‑commentary. This helps ensure the output is a continuous paragraph‑style summary, matching common summarization needs and reducing the risk of the model choosing an undesired format.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Preservation of your length requirement**:\n",
      "Your original constraint \"in exactly 4 sentences\" is kept verbatim at the end of the final prompt. This maintains your strict requirement while being combined with richer behavioral instructions, so the model now optimizes both form (4 sentences) and quality (coverage, style, and coherence).\n",
      "\n",
      "Main takeaway: your starting prompt correctly focused on the task and sentence count, and the optimized version builds on that by specifying role, desired abstraction level, style, content selection rules, and formatting. When crafting prompts, keep your core goal (here, a 4‑sentence summary) and add clear guidance on *what to include, what to omit, and how the output should look and read.*\n"

      "[2025-12-07 18:57:26,072] [INFO] [assistant.run] - Your initial prompt was clear in its request for a summary, but the final prompt enhances clarity and structure. The phrase 'Please provide a concise summary of the given text' sets a polite and formal tone, which can encourage a more thoughtful response. The instruction to 'capture the main ideas clearly and succinctly' emphasizes the importance of clarity, guiding the AI to focus on the essence of the text. Additionally, the phrase 'distilling the essential points without unnecessary details' further refines the request, ensuring that the summary remains focused and relevant. The final prompt also maintains the original requirements of limiting the response to four sentences and starting with 'Summary:', but it presents these instructions in a more organized manner. Key takeaway: When crafting prompts, aim for clarity and specificity to guide the AI effectively while maintaining a polite tone.\n"
