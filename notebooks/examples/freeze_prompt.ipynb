The improved version begins with a polite request ('Please provide'), which sets a more respectful tone. It emphasizes the need for a 'concise summary' and specifies that the response should be 'clear and focused', guiding the AI to prioritize clarity. Additionally, the phrase 'capture the main ideas without unnecessary elaboration' instructs the AI to avoid extraneous details, which enhances the quality of the summary. The final prompt retains your original intent of summarizing in 4 sentences but adds context and structure, making it more effective. A key lesson here is to include clear instructions on the desired qualities of the response to ensure it meets your expectations.\n"

The final prompt effectively removes these tags while retaining the core instructions, making it cleaner and more straightforward. By simplifying the structure, the prompt becomes easier for the AI to interpret and respond to without any potential confusion caused by formatting. The essential requirements—summarizing in 4 sentences and starting with 'Summary:'—are preserved, ensuring that the intent remains intact. A key lesson here is to avoid extraneous formatting unless it serves a specific purpose, as clarity is crucial in prompt engineering.\n"
