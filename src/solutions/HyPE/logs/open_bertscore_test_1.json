The logical thing was to buy the one in Sainsbury's, but I knew my husband and mother-in-law would pull me up.\"\nAll financial decisions - from holidays to furniture - were taken by her husband.\n\"He chose my car. On one occasion, as we were driving away from my parents' house, he shouted out of the window: 'She got to choose the colour.' It was very derogatory.\"\nWhen her husband began to withdraw large sums of money from their joint account to spend on motor bikes, she tried to warn the bank.\nEventually her husband used up all their savings, and was declared bankrupt.  Jane inherited the debts, and over \u00c2\u00a34,000 of arrears on the mortgage.\nShe now lives with her five year-old daughter in her parents' house. Due to her poor credit rating, she will not be able to get a mortgage - or rent a private flat - for at least six years.\nA recent report for the TUC and the charity Women's Aid  - called Unequal Trapped and Controlled - found that financial abuse was often the first sign of further emotional or domestic abuse.\nThe authors of that report, Marilyn Howard and Amy Skipp, say the ten most frequent signs to look out for are a partner who:\nUnder the Serious Crime Act - which has received royal assent, and which will be implemented later this year - coercive and controlling behaviour between partners will become illegal for the first time.\nSection 76 of the Act allows for a maximum prison sentence of five years, where someone's behaviour causes alarm or serious distress to their partner. This can include financial abuse.\nAs a result, the Police will be given training in how to spot instances of coercive control.\nPolly Neate, the chief executive of Women's Aid, believes the law will encourage victims to come forward.\n\"We know of many cases where women have not come forward about controlling coercive abuse - including financial abuse - because they feel the Police won't take any action unless they've been physically assaulted.\nWe're hoping this new law will change that,\" she says.\nBut there is widespread concern about another development - the roll-out of Universal Credit (UC).\nThe benefit is paid monthly on a household basis. The TUC report warns that UC will make it easier for one partner to control the finances.\nEven though the DWP has promised to make split payments where necessary, Polly Neate thinks many victims will still acquiesce.\n\"Universal Credit, as currently planned, is another tool for people who want to financially abuse their partner,\" she claims.\nMoney Advice Service 0300 500 5000\nNational Domestic Violence Helpline 0808 2000 247\nFor Jane - as for many couples - having a joint account was a particular difficulty. She wasn't able to stop her husband taking exactly what he wanted from it.\nThe banks say that generally they are not able to intervene in such disputes.\nHSBC, for example, will only put restrictions on a joint account if it has advice from the Police to do so.\nRoyal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyds and NatWest will block an account if they are formally notified that there is a marital dispute.\nHowever the banking industry says it is open to change on the issue.\n\"We would be happy to consider what more might be done to help in this difficult and complex area,\" said a spokesperson for the British Bankers Association (BBA).\nIn the meantime Nationwide suggests that people may like to consider joint accounts for paying bills, but individual accounts for their salaries.\nOn savings accounts, it is also possible to require both parties to sign before money can be withdrawn.\nFurther advice comes from psychologist Corinne Sweet, the author of \"Stop Fighting about Money\".\nSpeaking on behalf of the Money Advice Service, which offers help on a financial abuse,  she says couples should learn to talk about money freely.\n\"Being open about money is sexy, because it grows intimacy. It grows trust. It grows a feeling of closeness,\" she says.", "<ans>Financial abuse, such as controlling spending, taking out loans, or monitoring purchases, can be an early sign of emotional or physical abuse and leaves victims in constant fear. It can lead to severe financial harm, including debt and loss of credit, and new laws may criminalize coercive behavior, though concerns remain about how Universal Credit could enable further control. Open, honest conversations about money can build trust and help prevent abuse.</ans>"]]}}
