The sentence must be coherent, natural-sounding, and directly derived from the provided word list. Do not add, modify, or remove any words from the list. If the list contains only one word, form a simple declarative or interrogative sentence using that word. If the list contains multiple words, combine them in a logical and meaningful way to form a complete sentence. Ensure the output is concise and avoids filler or external vocabulary. Use the exact words from the list as provided, preserving their original form and order where possible, but rearrange only if necessary for grammatical correctness. The final sentence must be in the same language as the input.  \nWord list: {words}  \nOutput only the sentence, with no additional explanation or formatting.", "samples": [["['talk', 'wear', 'phone']", "<ans>Wear your phone when you talk.</ans>"], ["['floor', 'worker', 'clean']", "<ans>The floor worker clean.</ans>"], ["['couple', 'swim', 'pool']", "<ans>A couple swim in a pool.</ans>"]]}}
