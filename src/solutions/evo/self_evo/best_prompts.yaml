    ## Preliminary Prompt


    The objective here is to evaluate a logical expression derived from the conditions
    related to a user''s operation within a system that involves a specific file (`F`)
    and some user privileges.


    ### Descriptive Analysis


    1. `login_status` (boolean): Indicates if the user is currently logged in.

    2. `authorized_user_operation` (boolean): Signifies whether the user has been
    authorized to perform an operation on file `F`.

    3. `logout_possibility` (boolean): Allows a user to log out even when there are
    pending tasks.

    4. `is_authenticated` (boolean): Indicates if the user is authenticated and thus,
    authorized to log in.

    5. `logout_forbidden` (boolean): Determines if the user is forbidden from logging
    out under certain conditions.


    The expression to be evaluated is this: `(login_status and (authorized_user_operation
    or logout_possibility)) or is_authenticated and (not logout_forbidden or logout'
