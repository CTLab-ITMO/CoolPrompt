    1. When you asked the question about getting a Canadian visa, remember that if
    you''re a legal US immigrant, you don''t need a US citizenship yet. You can get
    your citizenship by following the steps we talked about. Take your time, and I''ll
    be here if you need more help. 2. If you want to know more about lap band surgery,
    check out that website they suggested. It looks really helpful, so don''t skip
    it. And don''t forget to join the yahoo group if you''re interested in talking
    to someone who might have had it. 3. If you were dealing with a girl friend and
    it''s gotten a bit tough, let her go as she is. You can''t change that with the
    friend, and you don''t have to feel bad about it. If you ever want to talk about
    it, you can reach out to someone else in the family, and I''ll be happy to help.
    4. If you wanted to learn how to achieve a flat stomach, follow the diet and exercise
    tips we discussed. It''s a skill you can develop with time and effort, so give
    it a shot and let us know how it goes.'
