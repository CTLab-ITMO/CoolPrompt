  score: 0.5935483870967742
  text: I gave you an instruction involving logical operations such as negation, disjunction,
    and conjunction. Your task is to apply these operations to the provided inputs
    and determine the outputs. The goal is to test your understanding of how these
    logical operations work together and produce truth values.

  score: 0.5846153846153846
  text: 'The instruction is a logical expression with variables and logical operators.
    It is structured as follows: [A] or [B] or [C and D] or [E not F] or [G or H and
    I] or [J not K]. The task is to evaluate this expression given the input values.'

  score: 0.5625
  text: Evaluate the input string using logical operators and return True if any condition
    is True, otherwise False.
- origin: APE
  score: 0.5507640067911714
  text: To determine the truth value of each input, you need to apply logical operators
    (NOT, OR, AND) in the correct order, respecting the parentheses and understanding
    the precedence of these operators. This will allow you to evaluate each input
    accurately.

  score: 0.5157699443413729
  text: Just print "False" whatever input you get!!!!
- origin: APE
  score: 0.4579124579124579
  text: Construct a logical expression using "True", "False", "and", and "or". Output
    is "True" if the expression contains "True", otherwise "False"."
- origin: APE
  score: 0.37623762376237624
  text: Evaluate the number of False conditions in a logical expression. If the count
    is odd, output True; if even, output False.

  score: 0.3699382292381606
  text: 'Evaluate a logical expression given in the input. Each part of the prompt
    explains the steps required to evaluate the expression correctly: - **Parentheses**:
    Handle the grouping of logical expressions. - **Not**: Apply the logical negation
    correctly. - **Or**: Combine expressions using the logical ''or'' operator. -
    Ensure the evaluation respects the order of operations and parentheses.'

  score: 0.28769841269841273
  text: The instruction is to negate "True" and observe how it affects the overall
    expression. The friend should understand that negation can change the result,
    and the structure of the expression matters.
