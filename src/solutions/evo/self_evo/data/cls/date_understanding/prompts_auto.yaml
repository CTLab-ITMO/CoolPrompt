    (7 days) before today. Use the same logic for all input-output pairs to ensure
    consistency in the results.

    weeks, or days from a given date.

    \ answers provided."
- text: Provide the date format, the action (calculate one week from today or a specific
    number of days ago), and the output format of the options. Use this information
    to understand how the outputs were generated.
- text: Please provide a date in the MM/DD/YYYY format. It was [specific date] a certain
    number of days ago. What is the date [number of days later/earlier] in MM/DD/YYYY?
- text: Calculate the date...<br>the first day of 2007. What is the date one week
    ago in MM/DD/YYYY?<br> add 24 hours (1 day)<br> subtract 7 days
- text: I told you about calculating the date one year ago from today based on the
    current date provided. For example, if today is Christmas Eve of 1937, one year
    ago would be June 2016. Similarly, when Jane thought today was 6/18/2019 but John
    thought it was 6/19/2019, John was correct, and yesterday would have been June
    18, 2019. Make sure to follow the formatting rules and adjust for any day before
    the month as needed.
- text: Give me a date, specify the month and day, and ask for the date a month ago.
- text: Calculate a date by adding one week from the input date in the first example,
    adding one day in the second example, and subtracting one year in the third example.
- text: Clarify the ambiguous date format, recognize that today was March 12, 2002,
    and correctly calculate one year ago.
