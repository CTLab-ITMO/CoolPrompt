  text: I told you about calculating the date one year ago from today based on the
    current date provided. For example, if today is Christmas Eve of 1937, one year
    ago would be June 2016. Similarly, when Jane thought today was 6/18/2019 but John
    thought it was 6/19/2019, John was correct, and yesterday would have been June
    18, 2019. Make sure to follow the formatting rules and adjust for any day before
    the month as needed.
