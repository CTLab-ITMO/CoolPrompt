  text: 'I gave a friend an instruction involving a series of swaps between three
    people, Alice, Bob, and Claire, following a specific sequence of swaps. The user
    provided several input-output pairs, each illustrating the outcome after a series
    of swaps based on the initial gifts each person had. The instruction was to have
    a fixed sequence of swaps: first Alice-Bob, then Alice-Claire, then Bob-Claire,
    repeated until all swaps were completed. The outputs depend on the initial gifts
    and the sequence of swaps.'
