  text: Solve a logic puzzle involving seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The
    puzzle required me to follow a series of clues and use them to determine the correct
    order of the objects. Each time my friend processed the instruction, they applied
    the clues correctly and arrived at the right solution. The process involved breaking
    down each clue, identifying relationships between the objects, and systematically
    eliminating possibilities until the correct order was found. This method helped
    my friend understand how to approach similar problems in the future by focusing
    on logical reasoning and systematic analysis.
