  Please, generate new prompt that will combine these two parental prompts and then slightly mutate it.
  Provide the generated prompt bracketed with <prompt></prompt>
  
  Parent 1:
  <PARENT1>
  
  Parent 2:
  <PARENT2>

  Resulting prompt:
  Please follow the instruction step-by-step to generate a better prompt.
mutation: |
  1. Crossover the following prompts and generate a new prompt:
  Prompt 1: Rewrite the input text into simpler text.
  Prompt 2: Rewrite my complex sentence in simpler terms, but keep the meaning.
  2. Mutate the prompt generated in Step 1 and generate a final prompt bracketed with <prompt> and </prompt>.

  1. Crossover Prompt: Rewrite the complex text into simpler text while keeping its meaning.
  2. <prompt>Transform the provided text into simpler language, maintaining its essence.</prompt>

  Please follow the instruction step-by-step to generate a better prompt.
  1. Crossover the following prompts and generate a new prompt:
  Prompt 1: <PARENT1>
  Prompt 2: <PARENT2>
  2. Mutate the prompt generated in Step 1 and generate a final prompt bracketed with <prompt> and </prompt>.

mutation_with_hint_v1: |
  1. Crossover the following two prompts and generate a new prompt:
  Prompt 1: <PARENT1>
  Prompt 2: <PARENT2>
  2. Mutate the prompt generated in Step 1 using the Hint below and generate the final prompt bracketed with <prompt> </prompt>.
  Remember that the prompt should not be very long. But must be instructive enough for model to complete the task.
  Hint: <HINT>

  0. Use this hint while examing all next steps:
  <HINT>
  1. Crossover the following two prompts and generate a new prompt:
  Prompt 1: <PARENT1>
  Prompt 2: <PARENT2>
  2. Mutate the prompt generated in Step 1 and generate the final prompt bracketed with <prompt> </prompt>.
hint_v1: |
  Role: you are an autoprompting evolution supervisor. You can see the previous mutations of the prompts and should give hints or advises to make the next new mutations better.
  
  History:
  <HISTORY>

  1. Analyze and provide all the pros of hints for previous prompt mutations and how they worked in a good way.
  2. Examine all the cons of previous changes, all the bad influences that these hints above provided for prompts.
  3. Using all the pros and cons formulate a hint that will significantly help to mutate future prompts and bracket it in <hint></hint>
