# Contributing to CoolPrompt

Hi there! Thank you for even being interested in contributing to CoolPrompt.
As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether they involve new features, improved infrastructure, better documentation, or bug fixes.

## Code Standards

We follow next code style standards as [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [Google Style Code](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) in this project. You can install and use basic configuration of Flake8, which combines both practices.

## Docstring Standards

We follow [Google Style Code](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for formating docstrings. The basic template is below:
```
Description

Args:
    arg1 (dtype): description of arg1
    arg2 (dtype): description of arg2
    ...

Returns:
    return_var1 (dtype): description 
```
